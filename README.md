# Welcome, my name is Danilo!

## About

Hello! I'm Danilo Sandrini, a technology enthusiast making a career transition. After 12 years as a designer, I decided to shift gears and dive into the world of IT. I hold a degree in Systems Analysis from Anhanguera do Brasil and am currently finishing my college degree in Information Technology Programmer-Analyst at Lasalle College in Montreal.

With 2 years of experience as a DBA, I'm always eager to tackle new challenges and learn more. I'm here to explore, contribute, and grow within the developer community. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
